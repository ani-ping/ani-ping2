Landing page! Here we go.

We are using the [Just the Docs] theme for this page, to build out the concept.

The goal is to create a photo reference site where you can filter by:
1. Character
2. Series / Movies / Game
3. Arc
4. Outfit / Form
5. Episode
   and also use the settings to avoid *spoilers*.
   
The Proof of Concept will target WP, as it has an extensive set of source material.

Features that I hope to create:
- Gallery for browsing without text/navbar
- Public photo repository
- Photo moderation/approval
- Search support, including "similar results"
- An Advanced Settings menu, where you can filter as mentioned above
- Support for Tags - assigning tags, searching by tags, editing tags, etc
- Descriptive text and text-to-audio support
- Translation support
- Advertising/monetization capabilities
